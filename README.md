# Flower_Machine_Learning
inspired by CAB320 ML assessment.
Please see './OG' for the original completed assessment and the given intstructions.

main.py follows the same specifications except it's in python instead of the notebook. (because Jupiter sucks.)

Expect another version where the same task is completed without the specification limitations
